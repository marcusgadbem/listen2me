# Listen 2 Me!

L2m! ([http://listen2me.io/](http://listen2me.io/)) is currently a work in progress application aimed at enabling friends to build videos playlists in real-time and collaboratively.
It is easy and fun to use: the approach is partially based on IRC style except that each #channel has its own playlist.
L2m! uses Youtube API as videos resource.

## Development notes

### Running with azk

Just type into your terminal:

```sh
$ azk start -o marcusgadbem/listen2me
```

**azk** will automatically clone repository, provision and run application and database all in an isolated way.
The application will also be configured under the domain http://listen2me.dev.azk.io/ withouth any efforts.
